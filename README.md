# Wharton Business Analytics Capstone — Case Study (PDF)

This repo hosts my capstone case study from the Wharton Business Analytics program.  
The analysis focuses on improving revenue and user experience under rising ad-block usage, using KPI design, an A/B testing workflow, and a weighted hiring scorecard to identify the best candidate for the execution lead role.
